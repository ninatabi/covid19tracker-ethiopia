# COVID - 19 Tracker | Ethiopia

Data source: WHO "https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv"

A current variation of the interactive mapping tracker is a demo-version of an upcoming more detailed region-based COVID-19 tracker. 
As of today, the tracker provides basic information on the daily and cumulative trends and ratios per 100,000 population.
Even though the tracker is focused on visualizing Ethiopia's pandemic situation, neighboring African countries are also included in the anlysis to shed light on the local regional dynamics. Global and continental analyses are outside of the scope of this interactive dashboard. 

Some of the most prominent sources of COVID-19 data include the following:

- Johns Hopkins University, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
- Our World in Data, https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus
